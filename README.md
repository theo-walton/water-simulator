# water-simulator
basic water flow simulator with landscape generation


watersim reads a file and interprets it as 3d coordinates and generates a landscape that goes through the points. Both the water and the landscape are stored as heightmaps.

buttons 1-6 give different water effects such as waves, rain and drains
